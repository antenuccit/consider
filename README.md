# CONSIDER 

CONSIDER —short for <u>CON</u>flicting <u>S</u>tudent <u>I</u>deas <u>D</u>iscussed, <u>E</u>valuated and <u>R</u>evolved— is a novel, powerful approach for effective collaborative learning in college courses, particularly in computer science and other STEM disciplines.

This project is a web-app implementation of the approach, using Python 2.7 and Google App Engine.
